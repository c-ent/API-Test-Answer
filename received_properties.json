        "description": "The construction of this one-bedroom studio has recently been completed and you will be the first tenant to make it your home! You will have your own driveway parking for one car and a separate entrance, including a patio. When you walk in through the front you will fall in love with the vinyl hardwood floor that is gorgeous and easy to clean. The kitchen has a clean quartz countertop and includes a refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, and convection hot plate. Please keep in mind that the hot plate only works with stainless steel pots and pans. The bathroom is beautifully constructed and has a quartz countertop sink and a large walk-in shower with a modern sliding glass door. Right next to that is the new stacked washer and dryer unit. The bedroom is well-sized and has a ceiling fan to help you circulate the cold air from the AC unit. Staying cool will be easy because every room has a ductless AC unit with their own remotes. The mailing address is only assigned to the main house, so you will need to set up a PO box for personal mail and a different shipping location to receive packages. Utilities to include internet, electric, water, trash, and gas will be a monthly flat rate to the tenant for $150.",

Schedule your self-showing today because this one won't last long! \r\n\r\nYou can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/birmingham-homes-for-rent\r\n\r\nAt Pure Property Management of Alabama, we offer two options for security deposits. The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy.  The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages, and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at the time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move-out.\r\n\r\nSorry, no pets.\r\n\r\nResident Benefits Package- Each lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefits Package for $39.00 per month. This package can include renters’ insurance; option B, for those tenants who provide proof of their owner renters’ insurance, is $27 per month, payable with rent. The AHI Properties Resident Benefits Package (RBP) delivers savings and convenient, professional services that make taking care of your home second nature. By applying, the Applicant agrees to be enrolled and to pay the applicable cost of $39 per month, payable with rent. \r\nYour RBP may include, subject to property mechanicals or other limitations:\r\n• HVAC air filter delivered directly to your door approximately every 90 days.\r\n• A resident rewards program that helps you earn rewards for paying your rent on time.\r\n• Credit building to help boost your credit score with timely rent payments.\r\n• $1M Identity Protection for all adult leaseholders\r\n• 24/7 online maintenance reporting\r\n• Online Portal: Access to your account, documents, communication, and payment options.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The total monthly cost of the Resident Benefits Package is all-inclusive, and no discounts will be given if any element of the package is unavailable due to a lack of HVAC or another limitation at a specific property. Residents providing both liability insurance and renters insurance (including naming the property management company as the additional insured) may choose option B which is $27/month, payable with rent.\r\n\r\nThe lessee(s) understand(s) that the move-in fee is a one-time fee of $ 250.00, that will cover the expenses of the administrative and periodic inspection for the execution of this Residential Lease Agreement and for the scheduling and performance of the periodic inspection.\r\n\r\nApplication Fee: $75.00 per applicant.

Top it off with a fenced in backyard with storage shed.\r\n\r\n\"For REDUCED move in costs, talk to us about our Security Deposit Replacement Program!\" We offer two options for security deposits. The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy. The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages and/or cleaning needed at move-out. If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move out. You can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/huntsville-homes-for-rent#properties?\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case by case basis with homeowner approval. A minimum $400.00 non-refundable pet fee will be charged for the 1st approved pet; then $250.00 per additional approved pet and a minimum of $30.00 a month pet fee for each pet. Each applicant is required to complete the appropriate pet profile via https://purepmhuntsville.petscreening.com/ This also includes those applicants with no pets. Applicants with pet(s) accept the non-refundable fee of $30 for the first pet and $20 for each additional pet. This registration is free for those applicants with no pets or those with certified assistance animals. *Terms and conditions apply\r\n\r\nResident Benefits Package- Each lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefits Package for $39.00 per month.

This process ensures we have formalized pet and animal-related policy acknowledgments and more accurate records to create greater mutual accountability. If you need accommodation in another way, please contact your housing provider. PetScreening charges a nominal fee for the creation of a Pet Profile for a household pet. This is a separate charge from the rental application fee. There is no ($0) charge for an assistance animal accommodation request and no ($0) charge for the profile created for tenants without a pet/animal.\r\nPlease get started by selecting a profile category on our landing page: https://purepmaustin.petscreening.com/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nTo view our leasing criteria, please click this link https://tx.purepm.co/pdf/PURE%20Application%20Criteria2.pdf",

With meticulous attention to detail, this property promises a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Don't let the opportunity slip by – seize the chance to call this gorgeous home yours!\r\n\r\n\"For REDUCED move in costs, talk to us about our Security Deposit Replacement Program!\" We offer two options for security deposits. The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy.  The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move out. You can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/huntsville-homes-for-rent#properties?\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case by case basis with homeowner approval. A minimum $400.00 non-refundable pet fee will be charged for the 1st approved pet; then $250.00 per additional approved pet and a minimum of $30.00 a month pet fee for each pet. Each applicant is required to complete the appropriate pet profile via  https://purepmhuntsville.petscreening.com/   This also includes those applicants with no pets.

Upstairs you have 3 spacious bedrooms, the master bath offers a double vanity and garden tub with separate shower. Don't miss this home!\r\n\r\n\"For REDUCED move in costs, talk to us about our Security Deposit Replacement Program!\" We offer two options for security deposits. The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy.  The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move out. You can apply today by visiting us at https://huntsville.ahiproperties.com/huntsville-homes-for-rent.\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case by case basis with homeowner approval. A minimum $400.00 pet deposit will be charged for the 1st approved pet; then $250.00 per additional approved pet and a minimum of $30.00 a month pet fee for each pet. Each applicant is required to complete the appropriate pet profile via   https://pureprop.petscreening.com/    This also includes those applicants with no pets. Applicants with pet(s) accept the non-refundable fee of $30 for the first pet and $20 for each additional pet. This registration is free for those applicants with no pets or those with certified assistance animals. *Terms and conditions apply\r\n\r\nResident Benefits Package- Each lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefits Package for $39.00 per month.

You will love the soaring ceilings, cozy fireplace, and a master on the main level along with a large glamour bath w/jetted tub. The kitchen has new appliances. The sun room is a great place to relax and enjoy a private backyard.\r\n\r\n\"For REDUCED move in costs, talk to us about our Security Deposit Replacement Program!\" We offer two options for security deposits. The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy.  The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move out. You can apply today by visiting us at https://huntsville.ahiproperties.com/huntsville-homes-for-rent.\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case by case basis with homeowner approval. A minimum $400.00 pet deposit will be charged for the 1st approved pet; then $250.00 per additional approved pet and a minimum of $30.00 a month pet fee for each pet. Each applicant is required to complete the appropriate pet profile via   https://pureprop.petscreening.com/    This also includes those applicants with no pets. Applicants with pet(s) accept the non-refundable fee of $30 for the first pet and $20 for each additional pet. This registration is free for those applicants with no pets or those with certified assistance animals. *Terms and conditions apply\r\n\r\nResident Benefits Package- Each lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefits Package for $39.00 per month.

The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move out.

        "description": "You need to see this great house on a quiet street in Pinson. This three bedroom 2 bath home features hardwood and carpet flooring, a generous partially fenced back yard, and a large storage building. It's got a deck to the side of the house to enjoy the outdoors. \r\n\r\nYou can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/birmingham-homes-for-rent\r\n\r\nAt Pure Property Management of Alabama, we offer two options for security deposits. The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy.  The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages, and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at the time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move-out.\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case-by-case basis with homeowner approval. Two pet maximum. A Pet Administration Fee is charged for each Pet; $400 for the 1st pet and $250 for each additional pet. Tanked, caged or animals kept in an enclosure will be charged $250 per enclosure. (Examples include fish in tanks, birds in cages, and lizards kept in an enclosure.) Each applicant is required to complete the appropriate pet profile. This also includes those applicants with no pets. Applicants with pet(s) accept the non-refundable fee of $25. This registration is free for those applicants with no pets or those with certified assistance animals. Monthly pet rent starts at $30 per pet and is based on the “Paw Score” risk level assessed by PetScreening.com.\r\n\r\nResident Benefits Package- Each lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefits Package for $39.00 per month. This package can include renters’ insurance; option B, for those tenants who provide proof of their owner renters’ insurance, is $27 per month, payable with rent. The AHI Properties Resident Benefits Package (RBP) delivers savings and convenient, professional services that make taking care of your home second nature. By applying, the Applicant agrees to be enrolled and to pay the applicable cost of $39 per month, payable with rent. \r\nYour RBP may include, subject to property mechanicals or other limitations:\r\n• HVAC air filter delivered directly to your door approximately every 90 days.\r\n• A resident rewards program that helps you earn rewards for paying your rent on time.\r\n• Credit building to help boost your credit score with timely rent payments.\r\n• $1M Identity Protection for all adult leaseholders\r\n• 24/7 online maintenance reporting\r\n• Online Portal: Access to your account, documents, communication, and payment options.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The total monthly cost of the Resident Benefits Package is all-inclusive, and no discounts will be given if any element of the package is unavailable due to a lack of HVAC or another limitation at a specific property. Residents providing both liability insurance and renters insurance (including naming the property management company as the additional insured) may choose option B which is $27/month, payable with rent.\r\n\r\nThe lessee(s) understand(s) that the move-in fee is a one-time fee of $ 250.00, that will cover the expenses of the administrative and periodic inspection for the execution of this Residential Lease Agreement and for the scheduling and performance of the periodic inspection.\r\n\r\nApplication Fee: $75.00 per applicant.

Please note that aggressive breeds are not permitted. Don't miss out on the opportunity to make this house your home. Stay tuned for more details on this home!\r\n\r\n\"For REDUCED move in costs, talk to us about our Security Deposit Replacement Program!\" We offer two options for security deposits. The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy.  The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move out. You can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/huntsville-homes-for-rent#properties?\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case by case basis with homeowner approval. A minimum $400.00 non-refundable pet fee will be charged for the 1st approved pet; then $250.00 per additional approved pet and a minimum of $30.00 a month pet fee for each pet. Each applicant is required to complete the appropriate pet profile via  https://purepmhuntsville.petscreening.com/   This also includes those applicants with no pets. Applicants with pet(s) accept the non-refundable fee of $30 for the first pet and $20 for each additional pet.

        "description": "Take a look at this great house in Birmingham! It's got hard surface flooring throughout, a laundry room, and a good floor plan. It's just a few minutes from Red Mountain Park, shopping, and restaurants. Be sure and see this one while it is still available. \r\n\r\nYou can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/birmingham-homes-for-rent\r\n\r\nAt Pure Property Management of Alabama, we offer two options for security deposits. The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy.  The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages, and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at the time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move-out.\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case-by-case basis with homeowner approval. A Pet Administration Fee is charged for each Pet; $400 for the 1st pet and $250 for each additional pet. Tanked, caged or animals kept in an enclosure will be charged $250 per enclosure. (Examples include fish in tanks, birds in cages, and lizards kept in an enclosure.) Each applicant is required to complete the appropriate pet profile. This also includes those applicants with no pets. Applicants with pet(s) accept the non-refundable fee of $25. This registration is free for those applicants with no pets or those with certified assistance animals. Monthly pet rent starts at $30 per pet and is based on the “Paw Score” risk level assessed by PetScreening.com.\r\n\r\nResident Benefits Package- Each lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefits Package for $39.00 per month. This package can include renters’ insurance; option B, for those tenants who provide proof of their owner renters’ insurance, is $27 per month, payable with rent. The AHI Properties Resident Benefits Package (RBP) delivers savings and convenient, professional services that make taking care of your home second nature. By applying, the Applicant agrees to be enrolled and to pay the applicable cost of $39 per month, payable with rent. \r\nYour RBP may include, subject to property mechanicals or other limitations:\r\n• HVAC air filter delivered directly to your door approximately every 90 days.\r\n• A resident rewards program that helps you earn rewards for paying your rent on time.\r\n• Credit building to help boost your credit score with timely rent payments.\r\n• $1M Identity Protection for all adult leaseholders\r\n• 24/7 online maintenance reporting\r\n• Online Portal: Access to your account, documents, communication, and payment options.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The total monthly cost of the Resident Benefits Package is all-inclusive, and no discounts will be given if any element of the package is unavailable due to a lack of HVAC or another limitation at a specific property. Residents providing both liability insurance and renters insurance (including naming the property management company as the additional insured) may choose option B which is $27/month, payable with rent.\r\n\r\nThe lessee(s) understand(s) that the move-in fee is a one-time fee of $ 250.00, that will cover the expenses of the administrative and periodic inspection for the execution of this Residential Lease Agreement and for the scheduling and performance of the periodic inspection.\r\n\r\nApplication Fee: $75.00 per applicant. Section 8 / housing assistance not accepted.",

The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy.  The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move out. You can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/huntsville-homes-for-rent#properties?\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case by case basis with homeowner approval. A minimum $400.00 non-refundable pet fee will be charged for the 1st approved pet; then $250.00 per additional approved pet and a minimum of $30.00 a month pet fee for each pet. Each applicant is required to complete the appropriate pet profile via  https://purepmhuntsville.petscreening.com/   This also includes those applicants with no pets. Applicants with pet(s) accept the non-refundable fee of $30 for the first pet and $20 for each additional pet. This registration is free for those applicants with no pets or those with certified assistance animals. *Terms and conditions apply\r\n\r\nResident Benefits Package- Each lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefits Package for $39.00 per month.

The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy. The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages and/or cleaning needed at move-out. If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move out. You can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/tuscaloosa-homes-for-rent\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case by case basis.

This spacious 3-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom sanctuary boasts an open-concept floor plan perfect for entertaining, complete with a sleek living room where you can unwind and listen to your favorite tunes.\r\nWhip up culinary masterpieces in the chef-inspired kitchen featuring ample cabinet and countertop space, complemented by gleaming stainless steel appliances. Laundry day is a breeze with the convenient washer/dryer connection.\r\n\r\nBeyond your doorstep:\r\nPrime location: Easy access to Interstate 65 puts the entire city at your fingertips. Shopping and all your daily needs are just minutes away.\r\nEducational haven: Minutes from the University of Montevallo, making this an ideal spot for students and faculty.\r\nCommunity charm: Townside Square offers a welcoming atmosphere with friendly neighbors and convenient amenities.\r\nDon't miss out on your chance to call this captivating townhouse your own! Schedule your self showing today!\r\n\r\nYou can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/birmingham-homes-for-rent\r\n\r\nAt Pure Property Management of Alabama, we offer two options for security deposits. The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy.  The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages, and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at the time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move-out.\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case-by-case basis with homeowner approval. A Pet Administration Fee is charged for each Pet; $400 for the 1st pet and $250 for each additional pet. Tanked, caged or animals kept in an enclosure will be charged $250 per enclosure. (Examples include fish in tanks, birds in cages, and lizards kept in an enclosure.) Each applicant is required to complete the appropriate pet profile. This also includes those applicants with no pets. Applicants with pet(s) accept the non-refundable fee of $25. This registration is free for those applicants with no pets or those with certified assistance animals. Monthly pet rent starts at $30 per pet and is based on the “Paw Score” risk level assessed by PetScreening.com.\r\n\r\nResident Benefits Package- Each lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefits Package for $39.00 per month. This package can include renters’ insurance; option B, for those tenants who provide proof of their owner renters’ insurance, is $27 per month, payable with rent. The AHI Properties Resident Benefits Package (RBP) delivers savings and convenient, professional services that make taking care of your home second nature. By applying, the Applicant agrees to be enrolled and to pay the applicable cost of $39 per month, payable with rent. \r\nYour RBP may include, subject to property mechanicals or other limitations:\r\n• HVAC air filter delivered directly to your door approximately every 90 days.\r\n• A resident rewards program that helps you earn rewards for paying your rent on time.\r\n• Credit building to help boost your credit score with timely rent payments.\r\n• $1M Identity Protection for all adult leaseholders\r\n• 24/7 online maintenance reporting\r\n• Online Portal: Access to your account, documents, communication, and payment options.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The total monthly cost of the Resident Benefits Package is all-inclusive, and no discounts will be given if any element of the package is unavailable due to a lack of HVAC or another limitation at a specific property. Residents providing both liability insurance and renters insurance (including naming the property management company as the additional insured) may choose option B which is $27/month, payable with rent.\r\n\r\nThe lessee(s) understand(s) that the move-in fee is a one-time fee of $ 250.00, that will cover the expenses of the administrative and periodic inspection for the execution of this Residential Lease Agreement and for the scheduling and performance of the periodic inspection.\r\n\r\nApplication Fee: $75.00 per applicant.

You'll love the hardwood floors that run throughout the house, and the cozy living room with a beautiful brick fireplace. The kitchen features an electric stove and refrigerator, and there's a one-car garage with a washer/dryer. Outside, you'll find a fully fenced back yard with a covered cement patio and space for gardening.\r\n\r\n*Each lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefit Package for $44.95 per month. This package can include renters insurance.\r\n\r\n*Please note: PetScreening registration is a required part of the application process for ALL applicants.\r\nTo help ensure ALL of our residents understand our pet and animal-related policies, we use a third-party screening service and require EVERYONE to complete a profile. This process ensures we have formalized pet and animal-related policy acknowledgments and more accurate records to create greater mutual accountability. If you need accommodation in another way, please contact your housing provider.\r\n\r\nPetScreening charges a nominal fee for the creation of a Pet Profile for a household pet. This is a separate charge from the rental application fee. There is no ($0) charge for an assistance animal accommodation request and no ($0) charge for the profile created for tenants without a pet/animal.\r\nPlease get started by selecting a profile category on our landing page: https://homevault.petscreening.com/\r\n\r\n*Rental Application Guidelines and Qualifications: https://homevault.rentvine.com/public/apply?unitID=266\r\n\r\n*For REDUCED move in costs, talk to us about our Security Deposit Replacement Program!\r\n\r\n*Are you an Owner looking for a property management company?

If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program.

Call us today to view this home!\r\n\r\n\"For REDUCED move in costs, talk to us about our Security Deposit Replacement Program!\" We offer two options for security deposits. The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy.  The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move out. You can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/huntsville-homes-for-rent#properties?\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case by case basis with homeowner approval. A minimum $400.00 non-refundable pet fee will be charged for the 1st approved pet; then $250.00 per additional approved pet and a minimum of $30.00 a month pet fee for each pet. Each applicant is required to complete the appropriate pet profile via  https://purepmhuntsville.petscreening.com/   This also includes those applicants with no pets.

        "description": "Welcome home to 1321 5 Mile Road!\r\nThis 3bedroom/1bath home features a large eat-in kitchen and a bonus room in the basement. Beautiful hardwoods are throughout the home. The large fenced in back yard will be perfect for entertaining or for play. NO SECTION 8!! Schedule your self-showing today because this one won't last long!\r\n\r\nYou can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/birmingham-homes-for-rent\r\n\r\nAt Pure Property Management of Alabama, we offer two options for security deposits. The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy.  The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages, and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at the time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move-out.\r\n\r\nNo pets.\r\n\r\nResident Benefits Package- Each lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefits Package for $39.00 per month. This package can include renters’ insurance; option B, for those tenants who provide proof of their owner renters’ insurance, is $27 per month, payable with rent. The AHI Properties Resident Benefits Package (RBP) delivers savings and convenient, professional services that make taking care of your home second nature. By applying, the Applicant agrees to be enrolled and to pay the applicable cost of $39 per month, payable with rent. \r\nYour RBP may include, subject to property mechanicals or other limitations:\r\n• HVAC air filter delivered directly to your door approximately every 90 days.\r\n• A resident rewards program that helps you earn rewards for paying your rent on time.\r\n• Credit building to help boost your credit score with timely rent payments.\r\n• $1M Identity Protection for all adult leaseholders\r\n• 24/7 online maintenance reporting\r\n• Online Portal: Access to your account, documents, communication, and payment options.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The total monthly cost of the Resident Benefits Package is all-inclusive, and no discounts will be given if any element of the package is unavailable due to a lack of HVAC or another limitation at a specific property. Residents providing both liability insurance and renters insurance (including naming the property management company as the additional insured) may choose option B which is $27/month, payable with rent.\r\n\r\nThe lessee(s) understand(s) that the move-in fee is a one-time fee of $ 250.00, that will cover the expenses of the administrative and periodic inspection for the execution of this Residential Lease Agreement and for the scheduling and performance of the periodic inspection.\r\n\r\nApplication Fee: $75.00 per applicant. Section 8 / housing assistance not accepted.",
