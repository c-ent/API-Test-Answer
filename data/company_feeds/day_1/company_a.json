With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move out.

With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move out. You can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/tuscaloosa-homes-for-rent\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case by case basis.

Schedule your self showing today!\r\n\r\nYou can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/birmingham-homes-for-rent\r\n\r\nAt Pure Property Management of Alabama, we offer two options for security deposits. The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy.  The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages, and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at the time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move-out.\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case-by-case basis with homeowner approval. A Pet Administration Fee is charged for each Pet; $400 for the 1st pet and $250 for each additional pet. Tanked, caged or animals kept in an enclosure will be charged $250 per enclosure. (Examples include fish in tanks, birds in cages, and lizards kept in an enclosure.) Each applicant is required to complete the appropriate pet profile. This also includes those applicants with no pets. Applicants with pet(s) accept the non-refundable fee of $25. This registration is free for those applicants with no pets or those with certified assistance animals. Monthly pet rent starts at $30 per pet and is based on the \u201cPaw Score\u201d risk level assessed by PetScreening.com.\r\n\r\nResident Benefits Package- Each lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefits Package for $39.00 per month. This package can include renters\u2019 insurance; option B, for those tenants who provide proof of their owner renters\u2019 insurance, is $27 per month, payable with rent. The AHI Properties Resident Benefits Package (RBP) delivers savings and convenient, professional services that make taking care of your home second nature. By applying, the Applicant agrees to be enrolled and to pay the applicable cost of $39 per month, payable with rent. \r\nYour RBP may include, subject to property mechanicals or other limitations:\r\n\u2022 HVAC air filter delivered directly to your door approximately every 90 days.\r\n\u2022 A resident rewards program that helps you earn rewards for paying your rent on time.\r\n\u2022 Credit building to help boost your credit score with timely rent payments.\r\n\u2022 $1M Identity Protection for all adult leaseholders\r\n\u2022 24/7 online maintenance reporting\r\n\u2022 Online Portal: Access to your account, documents, communication, and payment options.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The total monthly cost of the Resident Benefits Package is all-inclusive, and no discounts will be given if any element of the package is unavailable due to a lack of HVAC or another limitation at a specific property. Residents providing both liability insurance and renters insurance (including naming the property management company as the additional insured) may choose option B which is $27/month, payable with rent.\r\n\r\nThe lessee(s) understand(s) that the move-in fee is a one-time fee of $ 250.00, that will cover the expenses of the administrative and periodic inspection for the execution of this Residential Lease Agreement and for the scheduling and performance of the periodic inspection.\r\n\r\nApplication Fee: $75.00 per applicant.

You'll love the hardwood floors that run throughout the house, and the cozy living room with a beautiful brick fireplace. The kitchen features an electric stove and refrigerator, and there's a one-car garage with a washer/dryer. Outside, you'll find a fully fenced back yard with a covered cement patio and space for gardening.\r\n\r\n*Each lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefit Package for $44.95 per month. This package can include renters insurance.\r\n\r\n*Please note: PetScreening registration is a required part of the application process for ALL applicants.\r\nTo help ensure ALL of our residents understand our pet and animal-related policies, we use a third-party screening service and require EVERYONE to complete a profile. This process ensures we have formalized pet and animal-related policy acknowledgments and more accurate records to create greater mutual accountability. If you need accommodation in another way, please contact your housing provider.\r\n\r\nPetScreening charges a nominal fee for the creation of a Pet Profile for a household pet. This is a separate charge from the rental application fee. There is no ($0) charge for an assistance animal accommodation request and no ($0) charge for the profile created for tenants without a pet/animal.\r\nPlease get started by selecting a profile category on our landing page: https://homevault.petscreening.com/\r\n\r\n*Rental Application Guidelines and Qualifications: https://homevault.rentvine.com/public/apply?unitID=266\r\n\r\n*For REDUCED move in costs, talk to us about our Security Deposit Replacement Program!\r\n\r\n*Are you an Owner looking for a property management company?

Please pardon our dust as we prepare this home for you.\r\n\r\nThis lovely home features a formal dining room with a trey ceiling and chair rail molding and a cozy living room with a fireplace.  The open plan with soft archways continues into the eat-in kitchen. Granite countertops, a tile backsplash, stainless steel appliances and an island with breakfast bar add to the convenience and easy cleanup of the kitchen.  A backyard patio offers even more space to dine and entertain!\r\n\r\nUpstairs, the primary bedroom boasts an en suite bath with a garden tub, separate shower, dual vanity and a walk in closet.  Four additional bedrooms share another two full baths, rounding out this spacious home.  Your new neighborhood is near parks, the I-485, restaurants and the Waverly mall.  We would love to tell you more about this home.  Call us at 877-751-1677 or schedule a self showing tour and apply at nc.purepm.co and for reduced move in costs, talk to us about our security deposit replacement program.\r\n\r\nSorry, no pets please.\r\n\r\nSecurity deposit will be the minimum of one, but not more than two months rent.\r\n\r\nEach lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefit Package for $39.00 per month.

You will have your own driveway parking for one car and a separate entrance, including a patio. When you walk in through the front you will fall in love with the vinyl hardwood floor that is gorgeous and easy to clean. The kitchen has a clean quartz countertop and includes a refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, and convection hot plate. Please keep in mind that the hot plate only works with stainless steel pots and pans. The bathroom is beautifully constructed and has a quartz countertop sink and a large walk-in shower with a modern sliding glass door. Right next to that is the new stacked washer and dryer unit. The bedroom is well-sized and has a ceiling fan to help you circulate the cold air from the AC unit. Staying cool will be easy because every room has a ductless AC unit with their own remotes. The mailing address is only assigned to the main house, so you will need to set up a PO box for personal mail and a different shipping location to receive packages. Utilities to include internet, electric, water, trash, and gas will be a monthly flat rate to the tenant for $150.",

The home is close to RL Young Elementary School and sidewalks are throughout the neighborhood. Schedule your self-showing today because this one won't last long! \r\n\r\nYou can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/birmingham-homes-for-rent\r\n\r\nAt Pure Property Management of Alabama, we offer two options for security deposits. The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy.  The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages, and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at the time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move-out.\r\n\r\nSorry, no pets.\r\n\r\nResident Benefits Package- Each lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefits Package for $39.00 per month. This package can include renters\u2019 insurance; option B, for those tenants who provide proof of their owner renters\u2019 insurance, is $27 per month, payable with rent. The AHI Properties Resident Benefits Package (RBP) delivers savings and convenient, professional services that make taking care of your home second nature. By applying, the Applicant agrees to be enrolled and to pay the applicable cost of $39 per month, payable with rent. \r\nYour RBP may include, subject to property mechanicals or other limitations:\r\n\u2022 HVAC air filter delivered directly to your door approximately every 90 days.\r\n\u2022 A resident rewards program that helps you earn rewards for paying your rent on time.\r\n\u2022 Credit building to help boost your credit score with timely rent payments.\r\n\u2022 $1M Identity Protection for all adult leaseholders\r\n\u2022 24/7 online maintenance reporting\r\n\u2022 Online Portal: Access to your account, documents, communication, and payment options.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The total monthly cost of the Resident Benefits Package is all-inclusive, and no discounts will be given if any element of the package is unavailable due to a lack of HVAC or another limitation at a specific property. Residents providing both liability insurance and renters insurance (including naming the property management company as the additional insured) may choose option B which is $27/month, payable with rent.\r\n\r\nThe lessee(s) understand(s) that the move-in fee is a one-time fee of $ 250.00, that will cover the expenses of the administrative and periodic inspection for the execution of this Residential Lease Agreement and for the scheduling and performance of the periodic inspection.\r\n\r\nApplication Fee: $75.00 per applicant.

The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy. The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages and/or cleaning needed at move-out. If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move out. You can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/huntsville-homes-for-rent#properties?\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case by case basis with homeowner approval.

Each applicant is required to complete the appropriate pet profile via https://purepmhuntsville.petscreening.com/ This also includes those applicants with no pets.

This process ensures we have formalized pet and animal-related policy acknowledgments and more accurate records to create greater mutual accountability. If you need accommodation in another way, please contact your housing provider. PetScreening charges a nominal fee for the creation of a Pet Profile for a household pet. This is a separate charge from the rental application fee. There is no ($0) charge for an assistance animal accommodation request and no ($0) charge for the profile created for tenants without a pet/animal.\r\nPlease get started by selecting a profile category on our landing page: https://purepmaustin.petscreening.com/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nTo view our leasing criteria, please click this link https://tx.purepm.co/pdf/PURE%20Application%20Criteria2.pdf",

This process ensures we have formalized pet and animal-related policy acknowledgments and more accurate records to create greater mutual accountability. If you need accommodation in another way, please contact your housing provider.\r\nPetScreening charges a nominal fee for the creation of a Pet Profile for a household pet. This is a separate charge from the rental application fee. There is no ($0) charge or an assistance animal accommodation request and no ($0) charge for the profile created for tenants without a pet/animal. \r\n\r\nEach lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefit Package for $39.00 per month. This package can include renters insurance.\r\n\r\nINTERNET SERVICE - if you require internet access, please make sure it is available at this property.

Don't miss the opportunity to make this your new home. As a responsible pet-friendly community, we require each applicant to complete the appropriate pet profile via our secure online platform.\r\n\r\n\"For REDUCED move in costs, talk to us about our Security Deposit Replacement Program!\" We offer two options for security deposits. The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy.  The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move out. You can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/huntsville-homes-for-rent#properties?\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case by case basis with homeowner approval. A minimum $400.00 non-refundable pet fee will be charged for the 1st approved pet; then $250.00 per additional approved pet and a minimum of $30.00 a month pet fee for each pet. Each applicant is required to complete the appropriate pet profile via  https://purepmhuntsville.petscreening.com/   This also includes those applicants with no pets. Applicants with pet(s) accept the non-refundable fee of $30 for the first pet and $20 for each additional pet. This registration is free for those applicants with no pets or those with certified assistance animals. *Terms and conditions apply\r\n\r\nResident Benefits Package- Each lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefits Package for $39.00 per month.

        "description": "You need to see this great house on a quiet street in Pinson. This three bedroom 2 bath home features hardwood and carpet flooring, a generous partially fenced back yard, and a large storage building. It's got a deck to the side of the house to enjoy the outdoors. \r\n\r\nYou can apply today by visiting us at https://al.purepm.co/birmingham-homes-for-rent\r\n\r\nAt Pure Property Management of Alabama, we offer two options for security deposits. The first option is a traditional security deposit, where a lump sum is paid at move-in and is held on account for the duration of your tenancy.  The security deposit can be used to pay for any unpaid charges, including rent and utilities, damages, and/or cleaning needed at move-out.   If your account does not have a final balance due, then the full security deposit amount will be refunded. The second option is our Security Deposit Replacement Program. With this option, you will pay a monthly non-refundable fee for the duration of your tenancy instead of the traditional upfront deposit. No funds will be held to use towards any balance on your account at the time of move out. You as the tenant will still be responsible for any charges assessed at move-out.\r\n\r\nPets are considered on a case-by-case basis with homeowner approval. Two pet maximum. A Pet Administration Fee is charged for each Pet; $400 for the 1st pet and $250 for each additional pet. Tanked, caged or animals kept in an enclosure will be charged $250 per enclosure. (Examples include fish in tanks, birds in cages, and lizards kept in an enclosure.) Each applicant is required to complete the appropriate pet profile. This also includes those applicants with no pets. Applicants with pet(s) accept the non-refundable fee of $25. This registration is free for those applicants with no pets or those with certified assistance animals. Monthly pet rent starts at $30 per pet and is based on the \u201cPaw Score\u201d risk level assessed by PetScreening.com.\r\n\r\nResident Benefits Package- Each lease will be enrolled in our Resident Benefits Package for $39.00 per month. This package can include renters\u2019 insurance; option B, for those tenants who provide proof of their owner renters\u2019 insurance, is $27 per month, payable with rent. The AHI Properties Resident Benefits Package (RBP) delivers savings and convenient, professional services that make taking care of your home second nature. By applying, the Applicant agrees to be enrolled and to pay the applicable cost of $39 per month, payable with rent. \r\nYour RBP may include, subject to property mechanicals or other limitations:\r\n\u2022 HVAC air filter delivered directly to your door approximately every 90 days.\r\n\u2022 A resident rewards program that helps you earn rewards for paying your rent on time.\r\n\u2022 Credit building to help boost your credit score with timely rent payments.\r\n\u2022 $1M Identity Protection for all adult leaseholders\r\n\u2022 24/7 online maintenance reporting\r\n\u2022 Online Portal: Access to your account, documents, communication, and payment options.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The total monthly cost of the Resident Benefits Package is all-inclusive, and no discounts will be given if any element of the package is unavailable due to a lack of HVAC or another limitation at a specific property. Residents providing both liability insurance and renters insurance (including naming the property management company as the additional insured) may choose option B which is $27/month, payable with rent.\r\n\r\nThe lessee(s) understand(s) that the move-in fee is a one-time fee of $ 250.00, that will cover the expenses of the administrative and periodic inspection for the execution of this Residential Lease Agreement and for the scheduling and performance of the periodic inspection.\r\n\r\nApplication Fee: $75.00 per applicant.
